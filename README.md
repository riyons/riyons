## About Me

Lead Software Engineer and full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into scalable, efficient, and impactful software solutions. With expertise in React, JavaScript (ES6), PHP, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I excel at delivering robust applications from concept to deployment.

I'm passionate about empowering developers through knowledge sharing. My technical articles on Dev.to explore advanced software concepts like centralized error handling and scalable architectures, while my free Udemy courses and YouTube channel "Developer Insights" provide practical tutorials and actionable tips for building better software.

Beyond development, I'm deeply interested in data analytics (certified by Google), Natural Language Processing, and Optical Character Recognition. Recognized as "Employee of the Year" for two consecutive years, I'm dedicated to mentoring teams and fostering a culture of growth and collaboration.

### My Programming Journey 🚀  

At 10 years old, my education took a one-year pause due to family circumstances, leaving me feeling isolated and uncertain about the future. During that time, my father noticed my curiosity about computers. Even though money was tight, he somehow managed to buy me a Visual Basic programming book—an unassuming gift that would change my life.  

What started as a way to fill empty days quickly became a passion. As I wrote my first lines of code, I discovered a world where I could create, solve problems, and push boundaries. That passion never faded. From those early days of self-learning to where I stand today, programming has been more than just a career—it's my calling.  

Even after 20+ years, I still keep that book with me like a treasure—a reminder of where it all began.

*This is the very book that started my programming journey over 20 years ago. Written in Malayalam, it was a gift from my father, who made sacrifices to buy it for me. To this day, I treasure it as a reminder of where it all began.*  

Now, I get to live that childhood dream, building innovative software solutions that bring ideas to life.

### [Centralized Error Handling System](https://github.com/riyons/centralized-error-handling-react)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tech-React-informational?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=white&color=3498db)

This repository contains the source code for my tutorial on building a centralized error-handling system in React using Axios, custom hooks (useApi), and service modules. The goal is to simplify error management, improve maintainability, and provide a seamless user experience.

✅ Centralized Axios Instance: Avoid repetitive configuration and simplify API requests  
✅ Global Error Management: Handle all errors consistently using Axios interceptors  
✅ Reusable Service Modules: Keep API logic modular and organized  
✅ Custom useApi Hook: Simplify state management for API calls (data, loading, error)  
✅ Scalable Architecture: A solid foundation for adding advanced features in the future  

### [Next.js Centralized Error Handler](https://github.com/riyons/nextjs-centralized-error-handler)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tech-Next.js-informational?style=flat&logo=next.js&logoColor=white&color=3498db)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tech-Node.js-informational?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white&color=3498db)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-package-informational?style=flat&logo=npm&logoColor=white&color=3498db)

A comprehensive, secure error-handling package designed specifically for Next.js applications that enables fine-grained, route-level error handling with custom error classes.

✅ Centralized Error Handling: Higher-order function for consistent error management  
✅ Custom Error Classes: Predefined classes like BadRequestError and UnauthorizedError  
✅ Enhanced Security: Prevents sensitive information leakage in error responses  
✅ Frontend-Compatible: Structured JSON responses for easy integration  
✅ App Router Support: Works with both traditional API routes and Next.js 13 App Router  

### [React Reusable Multistep Form](https://github.com/riyons/react-multistep-form-using-context-api)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tech-Hooks-informational?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=white&color=3498db)

A reusable multi-step form component implemented using React Context API and Hooks, designed to prevent unsaved changes from being lost during navigation between form steps.

✅ Context API State Management: Share state between components without prop drilling  
✅ Reusable Component Architecture: Call from anywhere in your React project  
✅ Dynamic Progress Bar: Customizable UI for tracking form completion  
✅ Navigation Control: Enable/disable navigation buttons from child components  
✅ Functional Components: Modern React patterns with Hooks and Context API
